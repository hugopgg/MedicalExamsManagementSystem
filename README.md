- ##### Description:
This project is a basic system designed for managing medical exams within a healthcare center. The system allows doctors to assign medical exams to patients (with all doctors, patients, and exams hardcoded). A random simulation assigns laboratories to exams based on the availability of exam offerings from each laboratory, which is also predefined. The system uses a simple GUI for interaction and simulates how exams are managed between healthcare providers.
